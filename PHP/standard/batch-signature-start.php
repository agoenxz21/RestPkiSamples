	However, since the marks are in reality changes to the PDF, they can only be added to documents which have no previous
	signatures, otherwise such signatures would be made invalid by the changes to the document (see property
	PadesSignatureStarter.BypassMarksIfSigned). This problem does not occurr with signature visual representations.
